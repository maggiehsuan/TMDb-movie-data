# TMDb-movie-data
TMDb movie data  (cleaned from original data on Kaggle)

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb),
including user ratings and revenue.
In the project I investigated the dataset regarding the following questions: 

Question 1: Genre vs. Vote Average
a. Is a certain type of genres associated with higher rating? Which genre of each subgroup (single-genre and cross-genre) associated with the highest rating?
b. Which year do the movies get the highest rating on average? Do the numbers differ by movies with cross-genre and single genre?

Question 2 Production Type vs. Vote Average
a. What ratings do the movies of production companies get on average? What does the distribution look like?
b. Which production type (coproduction or non-copro) associated with higher ratings?
